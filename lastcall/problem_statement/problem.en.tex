\noindent Ding, ding, ding! The bell rings and the bar is closing. 
You hurry to the bar to order your last drink, but the masses of people get there first. 
When you finally get to order your drink the bar is almost out of alcohol. 
As you order your drink you decide to tell the bartender a list of drinks you would accept - the remaining bar visitors find this to be a good idea, and follow your example.

The bartender is a bit confused by the list of drinks, but is never the less a good bartender and tries to make drinks that pleases most customers.
Perhaps you can help him out by telling him which drinks to make, for the most customers?
